# Loginify - Django Project

**Loginify** is a Django-based web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their profile. The project provides secure user authentication, allowing users to manage their personal information, including email and password. It is built using Django and SQLite for easy deployment, and can be extended to include additional features like password reset functionality, user roles, and third-party authentication.
